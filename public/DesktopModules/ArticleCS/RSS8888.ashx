<title>Sexual Assault: A conversation with a survivor</title>
<link>http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/586292/sexual-assault-a-conversation-with-a-survivor.aspx</link>
<description>She had just returned from a party her freshman year in college when a close friend of the family and trusted mentor did the unthinkable. It was the first weekend she’d been allowed to stay off campus. After having one too many drinks she was picked up from the party by her boyfriend and driven to the home of her rapist to sleep it off until morning. Her boyfriend left thinking she was in good hands and that’s when the man she looked up to as a father figure took advantage of the drunk 18 year old passed out in his house.&lt;br/&gt;

<link>http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/583814/af-sexual-assault-prevention-moving-in-the-right-direction.aspx</link>
<description>“I was raised in a household where you take responsibility for your own actions and don’t blame others for your downfalls,” said Tech. Sgt. Kathleen Thorburn.  “Instead of seeing a crime that had occurred, all I could see were my mistakes. Why did I go to that party? Why did I accept the drink? Why did I laugh at their jokes? Why didn’t I scream?”&lt;br/&gt;

<title>Wingman now a part of BMT culture</title>
<link>http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/547438/wingman-now-a-part-of-bmt-culture.aspx</link>
<description>Glamorized during the ‘80s movie ‘Top Gun,’ the concept of a wingman was to always keep the lead pilot safe, even at the cost of veering off to fight the enemy.  For the past few years, “wingman” has become a pledge, promise and commitment between Airmen to take care of themselves and those around them. 

Today, at the Air Force’s only basic military training unit at Joint Base San Antonio – Lackland, Texas, the term is taking on an even different meaning. A Wingman leads by example and takes action when needed, and the term is also used here as a way to take a stand against sexual assault.
