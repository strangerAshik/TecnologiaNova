<title>Training at Tuskegee: Turning dreams into reality</title>
<link>http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/473258/training-at-tuskegee-turning-dreams-into-reality.aspx</link>
<description>Training young men to be the first African American pilots in the military was a history-making event for the handful of trainers and leaders at the Tuskegee Institute. Creating an airfield from the ground up, the &quot;Tuskegee experiment&quot; led the way for desegregation of the military less than a decade later.&lt;br/&gt;

<title>Black Airmen turn racism, bigotry into opportunity</title>
<link>http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/473251/black-airmen-turn-racism-bigotry-into-opportunity.aspx</link>
<description>On a hot July day in 1941 on a desolate field in Tuskegee, Ala.,, 13 young African-American Airmen began an experiment by senior Army leaders to teach them how to become pilots. That experiment turned into the ultimate opportunity for these young men to become a valued part of the military and would go on to have an impact with the desegregation of the military. &lt;br/&gt;
