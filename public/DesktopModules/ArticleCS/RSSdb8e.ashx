<title>Airman keeps serving after overcoming rare cancer</title>
<link>http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/641995/airman-keeps-serving-after-overcoming-rare-cancer.aspx</link>
<description>&quot;Death smiles at us all. All a man can do is smile back.&quot; -- Maximus. This quote from the movie “Gladiator” rings powerful and true to Tech. Sgt. LaPaul Williams, who said, &quot;I don&#39;t believe death is to be feared.&quot; Williams, a 5th Air Support Operations Squadron fighter duty technician stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, was diagnosed with a rare type of cancer.&lt;br/&gt;

<title>Airman balances cycling with Air Guard mission</title>
<link>http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/641878/airman-balances-cycling-with-air-guard-mission.aspx</link>
<description>With endurance cycling, nearly every part of the sport is tough; from the demands of distance and the quality of the competitors, to the changing natural elements on any given day. For Tech. Sgt. Dwayne Farr, those difficulties pale in comparison with splitting his time between the grind of bicycle training to his no-fail mission with the Oregon Air National Guard.&lt;br/&gt;

<description>The alarm rings. Yelling is heard from the nearby hallway. As footsteps get closer, Vickie Tippitt knows she is in a world of trouble. Her grandmother bursts through the door. With a rope in hand, Tippitt feels the wrath of child abuse come down on her by her own flesh and blood. That was the life of one woman until she finally found her calling in the Air Force.&lt;br/&gt;
